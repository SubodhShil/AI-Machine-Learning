# **```Linear Regression```**

In the context of linear regression, the equation \(y = mx + c\) is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (\(y\)) and one or more independent variables (\(x\)). Here's what each variable represents and how they contribute to the model:

- **\(y\)**: This is the dependent variable, also known as the outcome or target variable. It is the variable we want to predict or estimate based on the values of the independent variables.

- **\(x\)**: This represents the independent variable(s), also known as predictors or explanatory variables. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, but in multiple linear regression, there can be multiple independent variables. The independent variable(s) are assumed to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable.

- **\(m\)**: This is the slope of the regression line, also known as the coefficient of \(x\). The slope (\(m\)) indicates the rate of change in the dependent variable (\(y\)) for each unit change in the independent variable (\(x\)). A positive slope indicates a direct relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), meaning as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases. Conversely, a negative slope indicates an inverse relationship, where as \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases.

- **\(c\)**: This is the y-intercept of the regression line, also known as the constant or bias. The y-intercept (\(c\)) represents the value of \(y\) when \(x\) equals zero. It indicates the baseline value of the dependent variable when none of the independent variables are present or equal to zero.

Together, these variables allow us to model the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in a way that can be used to make predictions or estimates. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (the line of best fit) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. This line is characterized by the slope (\(m\)) and the y-intercept (\(c\)), which are estimated from the data using statistical methods.
