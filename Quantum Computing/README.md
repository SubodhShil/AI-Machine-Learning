# **```Quantum Computer```**

> A quantum computer is a device that manipulates information using the mathematics of quantum mechanics, as opposed to binary logic. For example, a quantum computer doesn’t represent information as 1s and 0s. Instead, its basic unit of information, known as a qubit, corresponds to the probability of being either 1 or 0. The qubit’s state is like a coin flipping in the air: before landing, the coin’s state is neither heads nor tails, but some probability of either. In quantum lingo, the coin is in a superposition of heads and tails. Similarly, a qubit represents a superposition of 1 and 0.

Today's computers use tiny switches called transistors to do math and stuff. These transistors work like light switches, either on (1) or off (0). Computers follow a step-by-step process to solve problems, kind of like following a recipe.

Normal physics works great for computers until they get super tiny, like the size of atoms. In 1975, Gordon Moore noticed computers were getting smaller and faster, and he said this trend would keep going for a while.

Right now, computer chips are getting close to the size of atoms, and that's where things get tricky. Regular physics doesn't work as well at that size. So, by 2024, scientists think we might need a whole new kind of computer that works differently!

Subsequently, it is important to accomplish the computing at atomic size that follows non-traditional physics called quantum mechanics.

In quantum computer, the bits can be 0 or 1 or both 0 and 1 at the same time, also know as superposition. And these of special type of bits are known as **qubits**.
