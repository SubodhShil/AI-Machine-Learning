1. A quantum computer can perform extremely fast DNA sequencing, which opens the possibility for **personalized medicine**.

2. Literature suggests that the minimum number of qubits to realize quantum supremacy is 50. 

3. Googleâ€™s 54-qubit computer accomplished a task in merely 200 s that was estimated to take around over 10,000 years on a classical computing system.
