> # `Quantum Mechanics`

> Quantum computing is a dedicated field of physics that focuses on the nature of objects in very small scale. The state is often described as 'Quantum State' in which classical physics rules are not practically applicable.

## 3 main properties of quantum mechanics

1. **Superposition**: Linear combination of quantum states.
2.
