# **`Computer vision`**

### `Source -> Sensing device -> Interpretation device -> Interpretation or prediction`

## How model predict picture

### `Input data -> Preprocessing (geometric transformation, image blurring) -> Feature extraction -> Classifier`

## Limitations

1. **Sensor**: Can create noise.
2. Viewpoint variations
3. Changing lighting conditions 
4. Issue of scale 

- Images are stored in multi dimensional arrays.
- 2D images are grayscale image or black-white image. 
- 3D images are colorful images (RGB)
