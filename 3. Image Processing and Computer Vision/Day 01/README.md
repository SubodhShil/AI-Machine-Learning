# **`Computer vision`**

### `Source -> Sensing device -> Interpretation device -> Interpretation or prediction`

## How model predict picture

### `Input data -> Preprocessing (geometric transformation, image blurring) -> Feature extraction -> Classifier`

## Limitations

1. **Sensor**: Can create noise.
2. Viewpoint variations
3. Changing lighting conditions
4. Issue of scale

-   Images are stored in multi dimensional arrays.
-   2D images are grayscale image or black-white image.
-   3D images are colorful images (RGB)
