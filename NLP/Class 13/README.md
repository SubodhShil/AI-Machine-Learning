1. **Error**: The difference between actual output value and predicted output value.
2. **Loss**: The error of a single data point.
3. **Cost**: The average loss of an entire dataset.

> Cost is the indicator for how good a model's performance it.  
> When cost high it means the model is less likely to be predict desired solution.

-   Good performance == Lower cost
-   Bad performance == Higher cost
