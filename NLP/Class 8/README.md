## NLP

1. **Document**: Sentence/Document is a single line textual data.
2. **Corpus**: A collection of documents.
3. **Feature**: A feature is an unique word present in a document. Single characters doesn't considered as a feature.
4. **Word embedding or word vectorization**: Turning words into numerical form since machine learning algorithms are not capable of processing string input. In this process words are mapped by numerical values. This is used for predicting next word, similar word/semantic.

    > **How model learns the pattern from the textual data?**  
    > =>

**One hot encoding**: A vector of 0's and 1's, where position of a word in a text is marked by 1 and rest of the word positions are marked by 0.
