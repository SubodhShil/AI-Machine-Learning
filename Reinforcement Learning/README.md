> # **`Reinforcement Learning`**

-   A principled approach to decision making and learning under uncertainty.
-   Simply, Reinforcement Learning is teaching a machine through trial and error or experiences.
-   Reinforcement learning tend to maximize long-term rewards in an environment.
-   The machine is not explicitly told which action to take among multiple actions.
-   Situation এর জন্য অনেকগুলো action হতে পারে, RL এক্ষেত্রে independently action নিতে পারে এবং সেই হিসেবে এর reward দেওয়া হয় । Action ভালো হলে reward ভালো হবে and vice versa ।
-   There will be no labels or pre-determined outcome dataset in RL scenario. It is totally based on machines decision or action.

> ## **`Unsupervised learning vs Reinforcement Learning`**

-   The common thing is that in both UL and RL it doesn't provide with any labeled dataset. But other than this similarity both process have own unique way to formulate outcome.
