# **```Regression analysis```**

> A regression analysis makes it possible to infer or predict a variable (Depended variable or **Criterion**) on the basis of one or more other variables (Independent variables or **Predictors**). 

&nbsp;

# **```Linear Regression```**

- It's a prediction algorithm.
- **Aim**: To find the best fit line with minimal error. Here, **```error = predicted point - actual point```**


- Mean is best fit line.


### Types
1. **Simple linear regression**: One feature and one target.
2. **Multiple linear regression**: Multiple feature and one target.


### Hypothesis

- **Model perspective**: Initial version of a model proposed after being trained using test dataset. The hypotheses model than tested, optimized and refined through the process of training and validation based on unseen test data.
- **Mathematical perspective**: Mathematical assumption that establish relationship between feature and target.

## Formula of linear regression
**```Y = mX + c```**  

Here,   
1. **Slop or m** refers the value that determine changes in variable 'X' how much affect in value 'Y'.
2. **c** is Y intercept.
