> # **`Decision Tree`**

Supervised machine learning algorithm utilized for both classification and regression problems.

1. **Is multiple feature required for decision tree?**  
   ðŸ‘‰ multiple features are not strictly required. However, if a decision tree has only one feature, it will have limited decision-making power because it can only split the data based on that single feature. In practice, decision trees are more powerful and effective when they have multiple features to consider, as this allows the tree to make more nuanced and complex decisions by evaluating multiple criteria at each node.

2. How to decide root node?
