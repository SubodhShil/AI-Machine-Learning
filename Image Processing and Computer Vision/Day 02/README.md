## Image

### Images are collection of pixels.

Types of image:

3. **Gray scale images**: Grayscale or black-white images can be described as a 2D matrix.
4. **Colored images**: RGB images can be described as 3D matrix.

### Image preprocessing steps:

1. Resize all the images to same size.
2. Convert images into array

### By default, OpenCV reads images in BGR format.

## Color combinations

### Primary Colors

1. **Red**
2. **Yellow**
3. **Blue**

### Secondary Colors (created by mixing two primary colors)

1. **Green** = Yellow + Blue
2. **Orange** = Red + Yellow
3. **Purple** = Red + Blue

### Tertiary Colors (created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color)

1. **Yellow-Orange** = Yellow + Orange
2. **Red-Orange** = Red + Orange
3. **Red-Purple** = Red + Purple
4. **Blue-Purple** = Blue + Purple
5. **Blue-Green** = Blue + Green
6. **Yellow-Green** = Yellow + Green
