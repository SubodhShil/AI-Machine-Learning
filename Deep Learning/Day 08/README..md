-   We use optimizers to fix error.
-   Loss function is a mathematical evaluation that help us determine an algorithm performance.

## Bias

> Bias is just a number that helps the neural network start learning. Bias allows the neuron to make better decisions even when all inputs are zero. Without bias, the neuron would always produce the same result for zero inputs, limiting its flexibility.

Characteristics:

1. Bias is an additional constant that keeps the neuron running or activated for the next step. Suppose, our prediction encounters negative value or 0. In this case the process will stop, so the bias will add a value to make the result positive ensuring the process keep on running. So that is how **Bias help offsetting the result and increase flexibility in neural network.**
2. Each neuron has individual bias.
3. Bias value can be change or update, thus it is a learnable property.
4. Bias determines if a neuron is activated.
5. Bias increase flexibility of the model.
