1. What is perceptron?  
   ðŸ‘‰ It is a simplest artificial neural network. It was first introduced to solve binary classification problems.

2. What is activation function?  
   ðŸ‘‰ It transforms to values into certain limit.

-   The number of inputs to the input layer of a neural network will be equal to the number of input columns.
-   Weight values are initialized randomly, but as training progresses, the neural network learns to adjust them based on the importance of each input feature. More important features are assigned larger weight values to contribute more to the final prediction.
-   Simple perceptron is a binary classifier.
-   Perceptron is not useful for non-linear data.
