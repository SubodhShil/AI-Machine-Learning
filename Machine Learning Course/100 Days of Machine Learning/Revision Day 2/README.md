**Features**: All the available input data those are independent.  
**Label**: What we have to predict or guess. Labels are dependent on the features data.

> **Q1**: Can we have multiple numbers of features and labels?

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - **Classification**: Which class or category the data represents. It classifies the data label.
     - Binary classification: Only contains two categories.
     - Multi-class classification: Contains more than two categories.
   - **Regression**: What to predict, guess or forecast *numerical values* based previously trained features.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: <ins>**No output or label or dependent variable is provided**</ins>.
   1. **Clustering**: The algorithm divides dataset into multiple groups or clusters based on similarity of features. So, within a cluster the data shared with similar traits whereas between clusters there are abundance of differentiable traits.
   2. **Dimensionality reduction**: To get the number of features/dimensions/columns/predictors in compact, compressed or reduced form by applying data encoding or transformation. Why we need this:
      1. **Minimize storage size**: Todays big data requires a lot of space which can lead to a long time to work with ML model.
      2. **To reduce model training time**: By reducing the training data size, we can reduce the training data time.
      3. **Interoperability**: Isolating specific features that required most and sack or freeze rest of features that are not so important.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Imitate real-world learning process of humans. Reinforce to do a task by providing rewards (if it continues to do the task in the correct way) or penalize (if it is not providing any good result).

| Predict house prices        | Given features like number of bedrooms, square footage, and location, determine the selling price of a house. | **Regression**     | As we have to predict house price which is a numerical value (if the problem asked to house will sell or not then it would be a classification problem)                                                       |
| Email Spam Detection        | Classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and characteristics.                               | **Classification** | As we have to classify between two groups where the mails are spam or non-spam                                                                                                                                |

Additionally, we're not provided with any labeled class. If we have provided with groups or classes then it would be a classification problem |
| Predicting Student Scores   | Given features like study hours, attendance, and previous grades, predict the final grade of a student.       | **Classification** | Grade is a group or class that pre-defined.
