# Ensemble Learning

A technique where multiple models participate to increase accuracy.

Types:

1. **Bagging model**
    1. Trains multiple models in parallel on different subsets of the data.
    2. It works in parallel where there is no direct connection among models.
    3. Drawing multiple random subsets.
    4. Example: Random forest, Bagging decision tree
2. **Boosting model**
    1. Sequential way method. With each model correcting the error of the previous one.
    2. Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boost
3. **Stacking**
    1. It creates a meta-model by combining various models.
    2.
